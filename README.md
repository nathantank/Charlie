This is my first project. The tasks below outline what I aim to do within this repository. It will be updated as necessary.
1. Become accustomed with using cobrapy and Escher
2. Using the lab assignment located within https://cnls.lanl.gov/external/qbio2018/Slides/FBA%202/qBio-FBA-lab-slides.pdf, work through the
   solutions to optimize for lycopene overproduction. 
3. Replicate results of at least one research article of my choice using metabolic engineering principles, cobrapy, and escher (to be expanded on)
